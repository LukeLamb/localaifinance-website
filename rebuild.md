# ‚úÖ **Recommended Strategy: Tailwind CSS + Astro + Mobile-First Redesign**

## Why this works for your SaaS landing page

### **1. Tailwind CSS (Utility-first, responsive by default)**

- Perfect for rapid layout and design
- Built-in responsive classes (`md:`, `lg:` etc.)
- Easy to maintain and tweak across breakpoints
- Great for gradient-heavy, modern designs

### **2. Astro (Static Site Generator)**

- Super fast performance (great for SEO and global reach)
- Easy integration with Markdown for blog previews
- Supports Tailwind out of the box
- Ideal for single-page marketing sites with dynamic sections

### **3. Mobile-First Redesign**

- Start with mobile layout first, then scale up
- Use **Flexbox** and **Grid** where appropriate
- Ensure touch targets, font sizes, and spacing are optimized for mobile

## üîß Fixing Your Current Issues

### ‚úÖ **Root Domain Issue**

- Likely a DNS misconfiguration. You‚Äôll want to:
  - Set up a redirect from `localaifinance.com` to `www.localaifinance.com`
  - Or configure Netlify to serve both via Netlify domain settings

### ‚ùå **Mobile Responsiveness**

- Common issues:
  - Fixed widths (`px`) instead of fluid units (`%`, `vw`, `rem`)
  - Missing media queries or Tailwind responsive classes
  - Overuse of absolute positioning

- Review your current HTML/CSS structure?
- Help you migrate to Tailwind?
- Create a mobile-first layout template for your Hero + Features section?
